Sigilz
======

Sigilz is set of meta-packages containing frequently used LaTeX packages and
macros.  It was created to reduce the amount of the boilerplate preamble that
LaTeX documents often have.

Quick start
-----------

To install the package, place the entire `sigilz` directory under
`~/texmf/tex/latex` and run `texhash` to update the cache.
