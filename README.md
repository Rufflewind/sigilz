Sigilz
======

Sigilz is set of meta-packages containing frequently used LaTeX packages and
macros.  It was created to reduce the amount of the boilerplate preamble that
LaTeX documents often have.

Quick start
-----------

To install the package, copy the entire `sigilz` directory to
`$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex`, where `TEXMFHOME` is `~/texmf` by default.
